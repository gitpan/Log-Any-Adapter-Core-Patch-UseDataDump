VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Any '$log';
     use Log::Any::DD; # shortcut for Log::Any::Adapter::Core::Patch::UseDataDump;

     $log->debug("See this data structure: %s", $some_data);

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Any dumps data structures using Data::Dumper with settings:
    Indent=0. This is rather hard to read. This patch replaces dumping with
    using Data::Dump which has nicer output.
